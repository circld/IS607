Reading Quiz: 'Tidy Data'
1. tidying
2. single observation units are in the rows and variables are in the columns
3. a. column headers are values, not names
   b. multiple variables are stored in a single column
   c. variables are stored in both rows and columns (this one is tricky)
   d. multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table
(denormalized)
   e. a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables (sometimes the
case for very large longitudinal datasets)
4. filter -  select a subset of rows
   transform - add another column (variable) or modify existing column
   aggregate - perform a function over the data partitioned into groups
   sort - reorder the rows of the data set according to some criteria

Reading Quiz: 'Introduction to dplyr'
1. advantages: 
    a. (usefully) constrains the number of functions available to help facilitate thinking around what you want from the data. 
    b. much faster than plyr
   disadvantages: 
    a. only works on data.frames
    b. plyr better suited for broader data transformation needs
2. advantages:
    a. uses sensible naming convention to make it clear what the input and
output classes will be (eg, dapply takes a dataframe and outputs an array)
    b. internally consistent function structure makes going from one plyr
function to another seamless.
   disadvantages:
    a. base R has a much wider variety of functions available for specific use cases.
    b. often faster than plyr

Reading Quiz 'tidyr'
1. unpivot = gather, pivot = spread
