IS607 Week 14 Quiz
Paul Garaud

Assumptions:
Internet connection: 20Mbps/5Mbps (Download/Upload)
Unzip speed: 3MB per second
Unzipped file: five times the zipped file size
Average zipped size: 90MB
Number of files per month: 700
DB Processing: 150MB per second (sum size for each month)
Aggregated data size: 1/n size of n files

Result:
2.7 years total time to complete all steps

Calculation:

Download:
single file size * count / (download speed * 60 sec * 60 min * 24 hrs)
= 90 * (700 * 12 * 8) / (20 * 60 * 60 * 24) = 35 days

Unzip
single file size * count / (unzip speed * 60 * 60 * 24)
= 233.33 days

Load
single unzipped file * count / (upload speed * 60 * 60 * 24)
= 700 days

Process
single unzipped file * count / (DB processing speed * 60 * 60 * 24)
= 23.33 days

Upload
(single unzipped file / number of original files in unit) * months /
(Upload * 60 * 60 * 24)
= 0 days

Total = 992 days ~= 2.7 years
