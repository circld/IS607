The above command brings in each row in the 'long' format of the data in the csv. This format, creating a 
separate document for each country-inequality-indicator combination, has the desirable advantage of making it
easy to query and aggregate over the data. While this avoids complicated, multi-level nesting, it also fails to
take advantage of some other natural possible aggregations of the data (eg, collecting all data points for a
country in a single document). In my estimation, the advantages of the querying ease outweigh any additional
conceptual consistency of a country-level aggregate.
